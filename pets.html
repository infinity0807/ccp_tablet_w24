        <p>
          Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days
          lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has
          gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long
          as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to
          avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like
          skills in chasing them.
        </p>
        <p>
          At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon
          suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on
          a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a
          ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.
        </p>

          shorthair breed. He was adopted when he was 7 months old. Van Gogh has
          been a people cat since he was young. He craves attention but needs
          alone time when he wants it. He is purely a masterpiece when his
          sapphire eyes staring at his human friends. He loves birds, rats,
          insects, and water from human mug
        </p>
        <p>
          Van Gogh is responsible for his household safety. But he gets scared
          when the vacuum machine wakes up. He tries his best to make defense
          but his beautiful fur coat gets messed up immediately when he gets too
          close. By the way, he likes his fur coat being brushed by himself. He
          bites when he does not get enough attention, but he always gets what
          he wants.

        <p>
          Rocket (also named huihui) is a 6-month pomeranian puppy with big eyes
          and a small, black cute nose. Rocket is named rocket because he runs
          so fast and energetic all day without even having some rest. Rocket
          loves to carry his little toy walking around the house and jumping
          towards my bed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rocket is friendly to all human beings. He will be a little shy at
          first, but will ‘say hi’ to you after a few seconds. He is also
          friendly to dogs, especially the small breed, because the large size
          dogs are hard for him to smell lol. If you meet rocket, don’t hesitate
          to say hi to him!! He will be super happy the whole day.

        <h2>pluto</h2>

        <p>
          Pluto is a five year old rescue dog of an unknown breed. He was found
          wandering alone and taken to the Valley Humane Society where he found
          his new family. From a young age, Pluto always had a special
          personality, he was known for being very very lazy! He spends most of
          his time staring out the window to keep watch of his house. Don’t let
          the laziness fool you because Pluto defends his family from the
          mailman and squirrels every single day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aside from his job as defender of the house, Pluto likes to have fun.
          Pluto’s favorite part of the day is his daily walk. Sometimes he even
          gets to go to the park and meet his neighbors. He also loves his toy
          duck, and only his toy duck. As a dog, it's in his nature to hunt and
          so he makes sure to get some practice with his toy duck
        </p>
