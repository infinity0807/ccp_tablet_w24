          My daughter learned to make these cookies at a baking camp at
          Zingermanns and has tweaked the recipe to fit the taste buds of her
          siblings. They are extremely sugary so the salt helps to balance it.
          Note, these cookies are best eaten very quickly.

          At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon
          suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on
          a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a
          ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.

          I learnt how to cook Coca-Cola chicken wings from my mother, and I've
          since tweaked her recipe to better suit my family's palate, making it
          less sweet. While the cooking process remains straightforward, the
          result is incredibly flavorful, and once you've tried it, you'll
          understand its delicious appeal!

          put the marinated chicken wings into the pot and fry it until golden
          brown on both sides After fry the chicken wings until golden brown on
          both sides, then pour a can of coke into the pan and bring to a boil
          Continue to cook for an additional 2-3 minutes until the glaze has
          thickened and coats the wings nicely Transfer the Coca-Cola glazed

        <h3>ingredients</h3>
        <p>
          skinless, boneless chicken breast 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 pinch salt
          and ground black pepper water 1 package curry sauce mix 1 can peas 5
          new potatoes, halved 1 package sliced cremini mushrooms 2 medium
          carrots, chopped 1 medium onion, chopped 2 cups jasmine rice
        </p>
        <h3>Step</h3>
        <p>
          Steps Place chicken in a large, deep skillet. Drizzle with olive oil
          and season with salt and pepper on both sides. Add 1/3 cup water to
          the pan, cover, and cook over medium heat until no longer pink in the
          center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. While chicken is
          cooking, pour 2 cups water into a microwave-safe bowl. Break curry
          sauce mix into pieces and add to water. Heat in the microwave on high
          for 3 1/2 minutes; remove and stir until sauce mix has completely
          dissolved. Remove chicken from the skillet. Cut into cubes, return to
          the skillet, and pour curry sauce over top. Stir in peas, potatoes,
          mushrooms, carrots, and onion. Bring to a boil, then lower heat and
          simmer until vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, bring
          remaining water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to
          medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been
          absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Scoop rice into bowls and serve curry on
          top.
